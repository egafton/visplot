Visplot Exciting News
******************************************

This page contains the latest updates, announcements, and assorted good news
from Visplot development. Check back here to see what is new, what is coming,
and what we have quietly fixed while no one was looking.

February 2026
==============

* New telescope available:

  The VLT has officially joined the Visplot family! After noticing that some
  users were already trying it out via the web interface, we decided to make it
  official and add full support. No more pretending it was an accident.

* New predefined targets available:

  * Blank fields:

    Until now, Visplot only included Northern Hemisphere blank fields as
    predefined targets that could be loaded instantly with a single click.
    We have now expanded this to include both Northern *and* Southern
    Hemisphere blank fields, because symmetry is beautiful.

  * Spectrophotometric standards:

    Since many users regularly rely on standard stars for calibration, we have
    added a curated list of predefined spectrophotometric standards. As with
    the blank fields, these are available for both Northern and Southern
    Hemispheres, so no one feels left out.


January 2026
=============

* The Visplot documentation page:

  A brand new documentation page for Visplot is now live:

  https://visplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

  It includes an expanded tutorial, this very news section, and several other
  useful goodies. From now on, this is the official go-to place for all things
  Visplot — bookmarks encouraged.

* Visplot peer-reviewed paper:

  We are preparing a peer-reviewed paper describing the Visplot visibility and
  scheduling tool. Yes, Visplot is heading into the literature!

  community.
