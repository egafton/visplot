Web interface for visplot
**************************

Visplot provides a user-friendly web interface accessible at https://www.visplot.com/. This online version is always up-to-date with the latest features and bug fixes, allowing astronomers to plan observing nights without the need for local installation. The interface includes all core functionalities such as target plotting, scheduling, configuration, and export options, making it suitable for both quick planning sessions and detailed observing run preparations.

The web interface is built using modern web technologies, including HTML5, JavaScript, and canvas elements for rendering visibility plots. It integrates with external services like Aladin for finding charts and provides real-time features such as SkyCam viewing (available only for telescopes at El Roque de Los Muchachos, including NOT, WHT, and INT; for other locations, SkyCam shows a blank screen and requires local installation). Users can save and load their work as compressed files, enabling continuity across sessions and devices. All data processing occurs client-side in the browser, ensuring no data is sent to or stored on the server.

Advantages
==========

The web interface offers several benefits that make it an attractive option for many users:

- **No Installation Required**: Access Visplot directly through a web browser without downloading or installing software, reducing setup time and system requirements.
- **Always Up-to-Date**: The hosted version automatically includes the latest updates, features, and security patches, ensuring users always have access to the most recent version.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any device with a modern web browser, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, providing flexibility for on-the-go planning.
- **Easy Sharing and Collaboration**: Since it's web-based, users can easily share links or export data, facilitating collaboration with team members or remote planning.
- **Integrated Services**: Seamless integration with online tools like Aladin for astronomical images and SkyCam for live sky views (for supported telescopes), enhancing the planning experience.
- **Low Resource Usage**: Runs entirely in the browser, minimizing impact on local system resources and avoiding potential conflicts with other software.
- **Universal Browser Support**: Functions reliably in all modern web browsers, ensuring consistent performance across platforms.

Disadvantages
=============

While convenient, the web interface has some limitations compared to local installations:

- **Internet Dependency**: Requires a stable internet connection for access and functionality; offline use is not possible, which can be problematic in remote observing sites or during connectivity issues.
- **Limited Customization**: Personalization options are restricted compared to local installations, where users can modify code or configurations directly.
- **Potential Downtime**: Dependent on the availability of the hosting service; if the website is down, access is temporarily unavailable.
- **SkyCam Limitations**: The SkyCam feature is only available for telescopes located at El Roque de Los Muchachos (NOT, WHT, INT); for other sites, it displays a blank screen and requires a local installation.
